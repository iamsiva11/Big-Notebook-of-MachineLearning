> I have been doing machine learning professionally for almost a year(doing deep learning for healthcare startup currently) and I'm completely self-taught.
> 
> A quick story on my ML journey. Back in 2011, in my sophomore year, I knew I wanted to be involved in ML professionally; but I didn't know how. My path to becoming proficient in ML had lots of ups and downs. With so much trial and error and almost no guidance. Initially, I wasted a lot of time in dabbling with lots of math heavy books and not knowing where I'm heading. Fast forward 3 years with a concrete plan in mind, I spent close to 2 years rigorously practicing ML(reading books, MOOCs, ML competitions ,etc) after work hours, weekends.
> 
> Moreover, I started off this work as a way to clean up and re-organise the ML notes I have taken in the past 4-5 years. Which I also used for preparing ML interviews; while giving plenty of interviews close to 6 months. And thought about why not make it useful for others as well as a way to benefit their ml journey.
> 
> Good luck, may the force be with you.

# What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for becoming a professional ML engineer.

My main goal I'm planning to achieve with this repo is to get anyone level up their ML skills in a quick timeframe. Especially, to get anyone make rapid progress in becoming ML professional and not repeat the mistakes that I made in my early years with ML. I have organised this guide in a way it’s open to anyone to get started in their ML journey

## Right way to approach learning ML

ML is a really broad field, it takes years if not decades to master ML. But it should not be the case for becoming a professional ML engineer.

Typical books and university-level courses are bottom-up. They teach or require the mathematics before grinding through a few key algorithms and theories before finishing up. This can be a good approach if you have the time, patience and appropriate background. Not everyone has so much free time or the desire to move through so much low-level material before getting to the meat and potatoes of applied machine learning.

Taking courses, reading books can be done once you get a grasp of how all the components fit into the big picture. While in the beginning; end of the day one needs to be in a position to know what are the things they know in ML and things they don’t know in ML.

# What's the top-down approach and why it works?

Top-down approach for getting started in applied machine learning actually works. They should feel familiar because it’s probably the same top-down approach that you used to learn how to program. Namely, get the basics, practice a lot and dive into the details later after you’re hooked.

# Learning paths


### ML professional path  

From zero(any background, not necessarily CS) to ML professional. I hope this serves as a reference for people who know ML and want to brush up few areas.

### ML rockstar path

From ML professional - ML rockstar(ML engineer to ML rockstar) ( I'm currently on this path :) )

Please feel free to make any contributions to make this better.

# What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for becoming a professional ML engineer.

I have been doing machine learning professionally for almost a year(doing deep learning for healthcare startup currently) and I'm completely self-taught.

A quick story on my ML journey. Back in 2011, in my sophomore year, I knew I wanted to be involved in ML professionally; but I didn't know how. My path to becoming proficient in ML had lots of ups and downs. With so much trial and error and almost no guidance. Initially, I wasted a lot of time in dabbling with lots of math heavy books and not knowing where I'm heading. Fast forward 3 years with a concrete plan in mind, I spent close to 2 years rigorously practicing ML(reading books, MOOCs, ML competitions ,etc) after work hours, weekends.

Moreover, I started off this work as a way to clean up and re-organise the ML notes I have taken in the past 4-5 years. Which I also used for preparing ML interviews; while giving plenty of interviews close to 6 months. And thought about why not make it useful for others as well as a way to benefit their ml journey.
